# Athena Roadmap and Goals
The Athena library is not complete! We are always interested in ways to improve and expand our library, and some of the features below will be marked as to-do priority.

# Athena API Goals
- [ ] Athena Project API
- [ ] Athena Benchmarker API
- [ ] Athena Function Safety API [^1]
- [ ] Athena Tokens API
- [ ] Athena Quantum Testing API [^2]
- [ ] Athena Classical Testing API [^3]
- [ ] Athena Package Manager API
- [ ] Athena Input Stream API [^4]

[^1]: Athena athCaller object and athBench integration.
[^2]: Testing methodology which facilitates fundamental unit tests of libraries and their components.
[^3]: Testing methodology which facilitates interactive, large, cross-library testing to ensure emergent safety of systems.
[^4]: A dedicated input source for game libraries. Intended to power platform blind applications that accept input from touch, keyboard, gamepad, and VR applications.
